This software was developed for the Haute école d'art et de design of Geneva, by request of Carina Ow, student in the Master of Arts in Design (Space and Communication) program.
We developed this application over a short period of 10 days using the Kivy framework, which was also absolutely new for us.

For these reasons I seek the understanding of the reader.
